#Sparta-Control-Flow-Story
##Long weekend homework, going over JavaScript control flow methods and creating a story.

###Task
To create a complex story using various control flow methods. It must:

* use every Data Type (integers, arrays, objects etc) 
* use if, if/else, if/else, if/else and Switch statements
* use every comparison operator (<, >, <=, >= etc)
* use at least one multiple condition per statement **if( true && true )** OR  **if( true || false )**
* Use as many in-built functions as possible: 
	* prompts and alerts are mandatory
	* other methods like length, reverse, indexOf, substr, and any others you can find
* The story should be fun and entertaining!!

###Subject
A branching story following the song, 'Actual, Cannibal Shia Labeouf' by Rob Cantor.  
Check it out on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/WCWoolley/Sparta-Control-Flow-Story).  
Knowledge of the song is important to achieve the true ending, linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0u4M6vppCI).

###Cheat Sheet
If you don't have time to work it out the following are the inputs for the true ending:

* Any name.
* Yes
* Yes
* 2
* No
* 1
* Either will work here.
* 2
* 2
* 1
* Kidney

There are nine other endings to be found, seven bad and two good.

###Challenges
I did attempt to make something of a quick time event within the code and spent a great deal of time trying to make it work with what I know.  
End result was concluding I'm missing a puzzle piece that I intend to add in later on.  
  
It was quite difficult making sure each branch closed properly at first without rolling on to a part of the story that shouldn't have been accessible.  
Correcting the positioning of the loops solved this problem.
